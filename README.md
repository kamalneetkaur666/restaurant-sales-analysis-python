Minor-1 project analyzing restaurant sales data using Pandas and Seaborn.
## 📊 Restaurant Daily Sales Analysis (Python)

### 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes daily restaurant sales data using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**.
The aim is to understand sales performance, identify best-selling items, and visualize sales trends in a simple and effective way.

The sales data includes details such as **date**, **food item**, **quantity sold**, and **price**. Using this data, the program calculates total sales, generates summary reports, and displays bar charts for better insights.


### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data handling and analysis
* **Matplotlib** – basic plotting
* **Seaborn** – enhanced data visualization
* **Google Colab** – execution environment


### ✨ Features

* Creation of sales data using Pandas DataFrame
* Calculation of **total sales and total revenue**
* Identification of the **best-selling item**
* Item-wise sales visualization
* Day-wise sales visualization using bar plots


### 📈 Output

* Total restaurant revenue
* Sales summary by item
* Best-selling food item
